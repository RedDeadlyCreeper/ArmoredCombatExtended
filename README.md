# Armoured Combat Framework

The Armoured Combat Framework is a [Garry's Mod][] addon which creates a balanced, realistic and fun to play combat damage system, simulating projectiles, armor and explosions, as well as engines and gearboxes.

IF YOU ARE HAVING INSTALLATION PROBLEMS, PLEASE POST ON THE FACEPUNCH ACF THREAD, NOT ON GITHUB.  Please only create an issue on github if you've found a bug, or have a suggestion.  The [FP forum ACF thread][] is a good place for general ACF conversation, suggestions, and help requests.

When submitting a new issue or suggestion to [ACF Issues][] page, please double-check that someone else hasn't brought it up yet. Be sure to check closed issues as well.  Common suggestions that have already come up are turbos, propellers, cannon sizes, and engines.
